#* SUMMARY
#One of the fastest growing languages of the past few years, Go was developed by Google to create performant and maintainable server software. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. In this talk we'll explore Go's history and purpose along with a high level view of its syntax, features, and tooling.

* What is Go?
A new(ish), general purpose programming language.  (1.0 released in 2012)

- Compiled
- Statically Typed
- Garbage Collected
- Multithreaded
- Concurrent
- Minimal
- Fast

: Compiled to native machine code. Write once, run everywhere. Single static binary makes deployment a breeze.
: Concurrency is part of the core language which allows us to easily create scalable services.
: Minimal language (only 25 keywords) makes it easy to learn and to maintain
: Fast has a few meanings. Fast to learn, fast development cycle, fast execution.

* Who's using Go?

- Google
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Netflix
- Dropbox
- Atlassian
- Uber
- Twitch

And so many more at: [[https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers]]

: Many companies have also released great open source packages to solve common issues

* What are they using it for?

Two major categories have embraced Go: *web* *backends* and *tool* *development*

Go was designed for server development but its ability to easily create zero-dependency cross platform binaries made it an instant hit in the infrastructure and system administration spaces.

Some popular projects chose Go for this reason:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Ethereum
- NSQ

* Why

Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson found Google's C++ and Java projects were often having trouble scaling to large codebases/teams/servers. They decided to make a language based around composing simple constructs which can fully utilize modern multi-core servers.

The focus was on three aspects:

- Fast compile times
- Concurrency
- Simplicity

* Concurrency

Concurrency support is offered through two first-class language features: *goroutines* and *channels*

Think of goroutines as incredibly lightweight threads and channels as queues or mailboxes which goroutines use to communicate.

There's a common Go slogan:

"Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating."

Because of these features, Go code is synchronous by nature and embraces blocking operations.

Any function can be run asynchronously in a goroutine simply by calling the function with the `go` keyword.

* Hello World
.play -edit code/go-intro/hello-world.go

* Hello World - as a HTTP server
.play -edit code/go-intro/hello-world-server.go

: wrap `calls++` with `r.URL.Path == "/"` check

* Deployment
.code code/go-intro/Dockerfile

* What's not to like?

Common complaints include:

- *Boilerplate* - manual error handling gets tedious
- *No* *generics* - analytics and ETL tasks are harder than they should be
- *Dependency* *Management* - packages have no version locking
